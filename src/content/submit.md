title: "Submit a Community"
---
Currently, the only way to submit a community to Discourse.Directory is via our [GitHub page](https://github.com/felicianotech/discourse.directory). To submit a new community, please follow the instructions in our [README](https://github.com/felicianotech/discourse.directory/blob/master/README.md) and then open a new Pull Requests (PR). If you don't have time for a PR, at the very least, open a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/felicianotech/discourse.directory/issues) with your request.

We're looking into the best way to submit requests for non-coders.
